# star-dodge-clone

This is a clone of a game called 2D Star Dodge which I typed in from an issue of Amstrad Action magazine in 1992. After a bit of searching I found [this page](http://scruss.com/blog/2012/09/08/2d-star-dodge-flies-again/) which goes into some detail about the game.

You can [play the game online](http://paf31.github.io/star-dodge-clone).
